Hi, I'm @theBreadCompany, a student at [Berufsakademie Rhein-Main](https://ba-rm.de), working for [DB Systel GmbH](https://github.com/dbsystel)
and interested in
  - everything network, server
  - hardware stuff, be it repairing computers at smd-level or creating random circuits with my Arduino or Pi
  - trains lol

I'm open to any advices, so feel free to tell me if there is any bad code (which will surely come across).
